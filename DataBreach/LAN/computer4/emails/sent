Hi Sarah,
I wanted to touch base regarding the current project timeline.
After discussing with my team, it looks like we might need some additional resources to stay on track, especially in terms of technical support.
Would it be possible to allocate some extra team members or bring in outside contractors for the next phase of the project?
I understand there might be budget constraints, but any support would be helpful.

Best,
James
