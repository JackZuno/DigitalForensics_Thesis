# Digital Forensics in Corporate Simulations

This repository contains the code and setup used for my thesis research:  
**"Digital Forensics in Corporate Simulations: A Study of Tool Efficacy and Analysis Techniques."**

I simulated four different types of cyberattacks using Docker, Bash, and Python to analyze forensic techniques and evaluate forensic tools.

## Simulated Attacks

- [Data Breach](./DataBreach/README.md)
- [Phishing](./Phishing/README.md)
- [Ransomware](./RansomwareEncrypt/README.md)
- [Malware](./MalwareSteal/README.md)

Each folder includes the simulation setup, scripts, and additional documentation relevant to the specific attack.
