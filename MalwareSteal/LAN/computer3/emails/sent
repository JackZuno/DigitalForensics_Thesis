Hi Sarah,

I wanted to touch base regarding the project timelines.We need to ensure that everything is on track for the upcoming deadlines.
Can we schedule a meeting to review the current status?

Let me know what works for you!

Best,
Emily

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for pointing this out. I will review the data today and see if there is anything we need to flag with the finance team.
I will get back to you by the end of the day.

Best,
Sarah
