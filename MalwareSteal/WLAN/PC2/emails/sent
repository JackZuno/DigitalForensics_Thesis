Hi Sarah,

I have tested the new features briefly. There are a couple of areas where the user interface could be more intuitive, but overall, I think the improvements are great.
I will give you a more detailed review later today when we meet up.

Cheers,
Jake

Hi Sarah,

We should be able to cover most of the requests.
I will need to take a closer look at the current budget allocation, but I think we can move some funds from the operations budget to handle the equipment upgrades.
I will confirm tomorrow after reviewing the latest financials.

Best,
Jake
