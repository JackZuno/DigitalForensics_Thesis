Hi Sarah,

Yes, we are on track. I have reviewed the presentation, and everything looks good so far.
I will double-check the numbers and let you know if there is anything off, but they seem accurate at a glance.

Thanks for sharing this in advance!

Best,
Anna

Hi Sarah,
I have just received feedback from one of our key clients about the proposal we sent last week.
They are asking for some urgent revisions, especially regarding pricing and timeline estimates.
I have started making the necessary changes, but can you review it and provide your input?
I want to ensure we send back a polished version by tomorrow.

Thanks,
Anna
