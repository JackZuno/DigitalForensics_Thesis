Hi Sarah,

I noticed some discrepancies in the latest data from the finance team.
I am not sure if it is just a minor issue or something bigger. Can you have a look when you get a chance?

Best,
John

Hi Sarah,

Yes, I got the updates this morning. There are some interesting trends we should discuss.
I am free after 5 PM if that works for you.

Best,
John
